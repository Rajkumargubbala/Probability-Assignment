    "* Classical probability is based on the concept of equally likely outcomes. It assumes that all outcomes in the sample space are equally likely to occur. The classical probability of an event is calculated as the number of favourable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes in the sample space.\n",
    "### 2. Empirical Probability:\n",
    "* Empirical probability is based on the concept of relative frequency. It is the ratio of the number of times an event occurs in a series of trials to thetotal number of trials. Empirical probability is often used in practice to estimate the likelihood of an event based on past data.\n",
    "### 3. Axiomatic Probability:\n",
    "* Axiomatic probability is a mathematical approach to defining the probability that is based on a set of axioms. It provides a foundation for the mathematical theory of probability and allows for the calculation of complex probabilities using mathematical tools.\n",
    "### 4. Subjective Probability: \n",
    "* Subjective probability is a type of probability that is based on personal opinions, beliefs, or information. It is a reflection of an individual's uncertainty or knowledge about a particular event and can vary from person to person."
